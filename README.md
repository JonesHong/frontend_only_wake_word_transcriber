# 🎙️ Multilingual Smart Voice Assistant

A feature-complete frontend-only voice assistant application that integrates wake word detection, voice activity detection (VAD), speech transcription, and intelligent interface design.

🌐 **[Live Demo](https://joneshong.github.io/frontend_only_wake_word_transcriber/)**

## ✨ Features

### 🔊 Speech Processing
- **Multiple Wake Word Models**: Supports Hey Jarvis, Hey Mycroft, and Alexa wake words
- **Intelligent Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Automatically detects voice activity with support for automatic/manual ending modes
- **Real-time Speech Transcription**: Uses Web Speech API to convert speech to text
- **Audio Playback**: Records and allows replaying of audio segments

### 🎨 User Interface
- **Bilingual Interface**: Complete Traditional Chinese/English multilingual support
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Switchable visual themes
- **Real-time Visualization**: Waveform charts, wake word score graphs, and VAD status display
- **Responsive Design**: Supports desktop and mobile devices

### ⚙️ Advanced Features
- **Flexible Settings System**: Adjustable silence timeout, model switching, and detection mode configuration
- **Logging System**: Complete system activity logging and debugging functionality
- **Modular Architecture**: Finite State Machine (FSM) based system state management
- **Pure Frontend Implementation**: No backend services required, deployable directly to GitHub Pages

## System Architecture

### Finite State Machine (FSM)

The application uses three states to control the flow:

1. **Initialization**: System initial state
2. **Idle**: Waiting for wake word trigger
3. **Listening**: After wake word detection, starts listening and transcribing speech

### State Transitions

- Initialization → Idle: Press "Start Recording"
- Idle → Listening: Wake word detected
- Listening → Idle: No voice activity for 3 consecutive seconds
- Any State → Initialization: Press "Stop Recording"

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Operations
1. Open `index.html` in a supported browser (Chrome or Edge recommended)
2. Allow microphone permissions
3. Click the "▶️ Start" button to activate the system
4. Say a wake word (Hey Jarvis, Hey Mycroft, Alexa)
5. After wake word detection, the system will play a notification sound and start listening
6. Start speaking, the system will transcribe your speech in real-time and display results
7. The system automatically returns to waiting state after speech ends

### Advanced Settings
- **Settings Button**: Click the gear icon in the bottom right to open the settings panel
  - Switch between manual/automatic ending modes
  - Adjust silence timeout (0.5-5.0 seconds)
  - Select different wake word models
- **Theme Toggle**: Click the 🌓 button to switch between dark/light themes
- **Language Switch**: Use the dropdown menu to switch between Traditional Chinese/English interface
- **Log Viewing**: Click the 📋 button in the bottom right to view system logs

## Technical Specifications

- **Audio Sample Rate**: 16kHz
- **Audio Processing**: 80ms audio chunks (1280 samples)
- **VAD Delay**: 12-frame buffer to prevent premature cutoff
- **Wake Word Threshold**: 0.5

## 📦 Model Management

### Included Models
The repository includes essential models for GitHub Pages deployment:
- **Wake Word Models**: Hey Jarvis, Hey Mycroft, Alexa (small size, ~800KB-1.3MB each)
- **VAD Model**: Silero VAD for voice activity detection (~1.8MB)
- **Whisper Tiny Quantized**: Smallest Whisper model for speech transcription (~40MB total)
  - Provides good transcription quality for demos
  - Suitable for GitHub Pages deployment

### Downloading Additional Models
For larger Whisper models (base, small, medium, large) with better accuracy:

1. **Using the sync script** (for developers who clone the repository):
   ```bash
   # Download all models from registry
   python3 tools/sync_registry_models.py
   
   # Download specific model category
   python3 tools/sync_registry_models.py --category whisper
   ```

2. **Manual download**:
   - Visit [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Xenova) for Whisper models
   - Download desired model files to `models/huggingface/Xenova/[model-name]/onnx/`
   - Update model configuration in settings as needed

### Model Size Reference
- **whisper-tiny-quantized**: ~40MB (included)
- **whisper-base-quantized**: ~75MB 
- **whisper-small-quantized**: ~195MB
- **whisper-medium**: ~1.5GB
- **whisper-large**: ~3GB

> **Note**: Only whisper-tiny-quantized is included for GitHub Pages compatibility. Larger models provide better accuracy but require local deployment due to file size constraints.

## 🌐 Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment
1. Fork or Clone this project to your GitHub account

# Using Node.js http-server
npx http-server

# Or use Live Server extension (VS Code)
```
